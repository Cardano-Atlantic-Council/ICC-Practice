Scenario 3: Amending the Constitution

Vote: No

Rational: The proposal is unconstitutional because it violates the guardrail thresholds established between 65-90%. Furthermore it exceeds the guardrail change by more than 10%. This is too big of a change. We considered the pros and cons of a No vote, where a Yes vote would allow the passing of the Constitution which at first may appear beneficial. This sets a precedent to lower thresholds too easily if we were to vote Yes. It is the recommendation of this committee for a proposal to be submitted to actually change the guardrail instead of threshold and try again.
