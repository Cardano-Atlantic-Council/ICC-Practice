Scenario 2: Increasing SPO Rewards

Vote: No

Rational: The changes are not supported by a subject matter expert and the protocol parameter committee as per the guardrails, as the changes are excessive. The Pool Pledge influence change exceeds the maximum change allowed of 10% which was in fact established by a group of subject matter experts. The committee recommends resubmitting the proposal that meets the 10% change requirement for Pledge influence and provide justification from subject matter experts that this change will not be detrimental.
